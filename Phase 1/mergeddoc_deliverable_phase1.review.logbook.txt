CODE PATTERNS:

* Team element 45345 - Inês Carvalho

Reviewer's Name:Simão Carrasco
Pattern 1: The subclasses both have common methods inherited from the template class, so it makes sense to identify this as an instance of a template method.

Reviewer's Name: Pedro Catarino
Pattern 2: The pattern was well identified and explained.

* Team element 54622 - Tiago Coelho

Reviewer's Name:Simão Carrasco
Pattern 2: It's not clear how this method allows access to a previous state of an object

Reviewer's Name: Inês Carvalho
Pattern 3: Explanation seems very generic for what the pattern does

* Team element 58013 - Rodrigo Lopes

* Team element 59208 - Simão Carrasco

 Reviewer's name: Inês Carvalho
 Reviews: Looks good to me

 Reviewer's name: Pedro Catarino
 Pattern 1: Everything seems to be correct.

* Team element 60597 - Pedro Catarino

 Reviewer's Name: Simão Carrasco
 Pattern 2: There is always only one instance of the class, so it makes sence to identify it as a singleton.

----

* Team element 59208 - Simão Carrasco

 Reviewer's name: Inês Carvalho
 Reviews: Looks good to me

 Reviewer's name: Pedro Catarino
 Reviewing code smell 1: Correct code smell identification and explanation, some typing errors to be corrected - "which" in the explanation section and "functon" in the refactoring section

* Team element 60597 - Pedro Catarino

 Reviewer's Name: Simão Carrasco
 Code Smell 2: Repeated pairs of the same arguments on multiple functions, so it makes sense to identify this as a code smell
