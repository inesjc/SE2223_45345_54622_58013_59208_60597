 This code is duplicated and is used many times throughout the code. It can make the code confusing and make the programmer lose his mind. Should be created a new function, and whenever it is necessary to do this task, we call this new function.

 This method is too long, so it would need to be better structured. It should start by implementing small functions that will be used throughout the code. Everytime it was necessary to do a task, the corresponding function would be called. By building several small functions like this, we would be able to build a more readable and organized code.
